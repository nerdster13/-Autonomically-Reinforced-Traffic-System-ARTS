# Autonomically-Reinforced-Traffic-System

The goal of this project is to develop an autonomously reinforced traffic management system that can effectively manage and optimize traffic flow in real-time. This system will utilize state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning to analyze traffic patterns and make real-time decisions to adjust traffic signals and redirect vehicles as necessary. By implementing this system, we aim to reduce traffic congestion, improve traffic flow, and ultimately enhance the overall efficiency of transportation in the area.

To see a demo of the project, download SUMO simulator from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/).
The driver code can be found in 3dqn.py.
Run the file from any python supporting framework.
